<h2 id="title">Boseman, Chadwick.</h2>
<p> Nov 29, 1976 - August 28, 2020</p>
</section>

<h3>This memorial website is created in the memory of Chadwick Boseman who was an American actor and playwright. </h3>

<p>
When posterity gets to write the history of Black icons, 
then Chadwick Boseman’s name will forever be permanently etched in 
the top echelons of Black people’s hall of fame folklore.</p>

<p> I woke up to the sad news of his passing on in 
    the early hours of Saturday morning 29th August 2020. 
    For one so unassuming, none would have ever known Boseman was privately
     battling colon cancer for four years, since 2016. Yet in recent months, 
     I saw pictures of him visiting young children with cancer at St Jude’s 
     Research Hospital in Tennessee where he distributed toys, joy, courage and inspiration, 
     yet he never gave anything away, as he constantly flashed his trademark Wakanda grin and wide smile,
      accentuated by the dazzling white teeth which melted hearts of global fans of Black Panther.
</p><br>

<p>At 43, it is a life cut tragically short, yet we have to celebrate Boseman’s 
    remarkable filmography and his acting prowess. He certainly cemented his place 
    and legacy amongst Black Pride, Black History, Black Culture and Black Consciousness inter-alia. </p>
<br>

<p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman was an American actor and playwright who became 
    highly respected movie star with several iconic roles. 
    He was born on the 29th of November 1976 and raised in Anderson, S.C.,
     by his mother, Carolyn,  who worked as a nurse, and father, Leroy, who worked in a 
     textile factory.He was born the youngest of three boys. 
While a junior in high school, Boseman was a serious basketball player but turned 
to storytelling and wrote a play named "Crossroads" and staged it at the school after 
witnessing the shooting death of a basketball teammate. After graduating from high school 
in 1995, he studied directing at Howard University (B.F.A., 2000). While a student there, 
he took acting classes in a summer program ofthe British American Drama Academy at the University 
of Oxford. After college, Boseman moved to Brooklyn and studied at the digital film Acadamy in Manhanttan. 
He supported himself by teaching acting at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem and 
he worked in the theater writting, directing and acting.</p>
<br>
<p>Transitioning to the screen, he landed his first major role as a series regular
     on Persons Unknown in 2010, and his breakthrough performance came in 2013 as 
     baseball player Jackie Robinson in the biographical film. His performance as a 
     man who had to keep his feelings hidden was generally praised, as was his atleticism. 
     He next played played line breaker prospect Vontae Mack in Draft Day (2014), starring Kelvin Costner, 
     before taking on the portrayal of music legend: James Brown in Get On Up in 2014. </p>
<br>
<p>Also worthy of mention is when Chadwick first appeared as Marvel superhero character 
    in 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War,” which made expectations for the impending debut 
    of T'Challa(Black Panther) king of the fictional African Country; Wakanda who has an alter ego. 
    He further went ahead to feature as lawyer and future Supreme Court Judge; Thurgood Marshall in Marshall (2017).  
    And then achieved international fame for playing superhero "Black Panther" in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) 
    from 2016 to 2019. The film was the first superhero movie ever nominated by the Academy Awards for best picture, 
    earning six other nominations and winning three.It was also one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, with 
    more than $1.3 billion in earnings globally. Its success represented a moment of hope, pride and empowerment for 
    Black moviegoers around the world. And it marked an inflection point in Hollywood, where decades of discrimination
     against Black-led films gave way to a new era of increased visibility and opportunity for Black artists.</p>


<p> T’Challa’s journey continued in subsequent films; he lived to fight another day in Avengers: Infinity War (2018), 
    in which Wakanda was the central background in the struggle to protect the universe, and Avengers: Endgame(2019), 
    in which T’Challa returned triumphantly to defeat the all powerful warlord who had threatened all existence.</p>


<p>In 2016, Boseman was diagnosed with the stage III colon cancer 
    and he died on Friday the 28th of August 2020 as a result of 
    complications related to colon cancer. He was 43.
Although Boseman never spoke publicly about his diagnosis, according 
to the statement, he worked through his treatment for most of his career years.
 During treatment, involving multiple surgeries and chemotherapy, he continued to 
 work and completed production for several films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, Ma Rainey, and others.</p>

<p>His final film: "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom",
     was released posthumously the same year to critical acclaim, 
     earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and 
     a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama.</p>

<p> Boseman was survived by his wife: Taylor Simone Ledward and family. </p>

<p>News of his death elicited widespread shock and grief,
     and many prominent figures in the arts world and civic 
     life (including Oprah Winfrey, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Martin Luther King III) paid tribute to Mr. Boseman.</p>

<p>As a fan of Chadwick aptly put it; Boseman was a beacon
     of light to people across the globe. His role in Black Panther 
     was ground-breaking and iconic. For many black children, he was the first major 
     superhero they could identify with. Rest in power to a genuine, virtuous hero. </p>

<p>I couldn’t agree with the fan more. I feel the numbing, gnawing pain 
    at the untimely loss of a life so young, but snuffed out in it’s prime, 
    one who had so much boundless potential, kindness and compassion to give to humanity. 
    Thank you for rising, for lifting, for elevating Black Pride. Rest in Peace Mr Boseman. Till We Meet Again. Wakanda forever.</p>
